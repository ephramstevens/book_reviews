# Sophie Quire and the Last Storyguard
### Author: <a href="">Jonathan Auxier</a>
### Rating: 10/10

The Sequel to <a href="https://ephramstevens.github.io/book_reviews//2025/01/12/Peter_Nimble.html">Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes</a> Sophie Quire and the Last Storyguard takes place in a town where books are hated and burned. One day, Peter Nimble brings her a special book, which unlocks a whole new world of magic. I really liked this book because books were a centeral part of the plot. This book brings back Peter Nimble and Sir Tode, and introduces Sophie and a new villain, who like King Incarnadine, seeks to destroy magic and make things in his city "normal".
