### Rating: 10/10 ###

Ranger's Aprentice is a series about a boy named Will, who grows up in the ward of Castle Redmond. On Chosing Day, when the children of the ward are chosen as aprentices, Will becomes aprenticed to the mysterious Ranger Halt. Will begins to learn what it means to be a Ranger, and undertakes a dangerous mission, which could have disasterous consequences.

This book grabed me from the start, Will is a very likeable protaganist and the story is very interesting, leaving space for many more adventures. Another thing that I enjoyed about this series is that there is no overarching plot, only single adventures.
